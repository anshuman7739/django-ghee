## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

#### 1. **`store/views.py`**

**Checkout View Enhancements:**
```python
# Added payment method handling
elif request.method == 'POST' and 'payment_method' in request.POST:
    payment_method = request.POST.get('payment_method', 'cod')
    request.session['payment_method'] = payment_method
    
    if payment_method == 'upi':
        return redirect(f'/checkout/?session_id={session_id}&step=payment-qr')
    else:
        return redirect(f'/checkout/?session_id={session_id}&step=review')
```

**Order Creation with Payment Status:**
```python
order = Order.objects.create(
    # ... other fields ...
    payment_method=payment_method,
    payment_status=payment_verified,  # True for UPI, False for COD
    status='pending'
)
```

**Context Variables Added:**
- `checkout_data`: Stores customer shipping info
- `payment_method`: Selected payment method ('cod' or 'upi')

#### 2. **`store/templates/store/checkout.html`**

**New Steps Added:**

**Payment QR Page:**
```html
{% elif step == 'payment-qr' %}
- Displays PhonePe QR code
- Shows total amount
- "I Have Paid" button submits order with payment_verified=true
```

**Review Page:**
```html
{% elif step == 'review' %}
- Shows shipping details
- Shows payment method (COD)

```

                                   ('upi', 'UPI Transfer')])

- 📧 Always verify payment status before shipping

### Production Deployment:
1. Set up email properly (SMTP settings)
2. Use environment variables for sensitive data
3. Enable HTTPS for secure checkout
4. Consider payment gateway integration for automatic verification
5. Set up proper logging for payment events
6. Run `python manage.py collectstatic`
