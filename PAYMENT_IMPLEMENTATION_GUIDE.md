# Payment QR Code Implementation - Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Updated Checkout Flow**
The checkout process now has 4 steps instead of 3:

1. **Shipping Address** - Customer enters delivery details
2. **Payment Method** - Customer chooses COD or UPI payment
3. **Payment/Review** - Shows QR code for UPI or order review for COD
4. **Order Confirmation** - Final confirmation with order details

### 2. **Payment Method Selection**
- **Cash on Delivery (COD)** - Traditional payment on delivery
- **UPI Payment (Online)** - Instant payment via QR code

### 3. **QR Code Payment Screen** (`step=payment-qr`)
When customer selects UPI payment, they see:
- Your UPI payment QR code image
- Total amount to pay
- Instructions to scan and pay
- "I Have Paid" confirmation button
- Option to go back and change payment method

### 4. **COD Review Screen** (`step=review`)
When customer selects COD, they see:
- Order summary
- Shipping details
- Payment method confirmation
- "Place Order" button

### 5. **Order Status Tracking**
Orders now track:
- `payment_method` - 'cod' or 'upi'
- `payment_status` - True (paid) or False (unpaid)

## üìã Files Modified

### Backend (`store/views.py`)
1. **checkout() function:**
   - Added payment method form handler
   - Routes to `payment-qr` for UPI or `review` for COD
   - Stores payment method in session
   - Processes payment verification status

2. **Order creation:**
   - Saves payment method from session
   - Sets payment_status based on payment verification
   - Clears checkout data after order

### Frontend Templates

#### `checkout_premium.html`
- Updated progress steps (4 steps now)
- Added payment method selection form
- Added QR code display screen
- Added order review screen for COD
- Improved button labels and navigation

#### `checkout.html`
- Same updates as checkout_premium.html
- Maintains compatibility with both templates

#### `order_confirmation.html`
- Displays payment method
- Shows payment status (Paid/Pending)
- Color-coded payment status indicators

### Static Files
- Created placeholder at: `store/static/store/images/payment-qr.png`
- **‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR ACTUAL QR CODE**

## üéØ How It Works

```
1. Customer adds items to cart
   ‚Üì
2. Goes to checkout ‚Üí Enters shipping address
   ‚Üì
3. Selects "UPI Payment (Online)"
   ‚Üì

   ‚Üì
6. Completes payment in their app
   ‚Üì
7. Returns to website, clicks "I Have Paid"
   ‚Üì

```

### User Journey - COD:

```

   ‚Üì
2. Goes to checkout ‚Üí Enters shipping address
   ‚Üì
3. Selects "Cash on Delivery"
   ‚Üì
4. Reviews order details

5. Clicks "Place Order"
   ‚Üì
6. Order is created with payment_status=False

## ‚öôÔ∏è Session Data Flow

The checkout process uses Django session to store data:

```python
# After address form submission:
request.session['checkout_data'] = {
    'full_name': '...',
    'email': '...',
    'phone': '...',
    'address': '...',
    'city': '...',
    'state': '...',
    'pincode': '...',
    'order_notes': '...'
}

# After payment method selection:
request.session['payment_method'] = 'upi'  # or 'cod'
```

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Add Your QR Code
```bash
# Navigate to static images folder
cd store/static/store/images/

# Replace payment-qr.png with your actual QR code
# or upload your QR code and update the template
```

### Step 2: Verify Settings
Check that these settings are in `ghee_store/settings.py`:
```python
SESSION_ENGINE = 'django.contrib.sessions.backends.db'
SESSION_COOKIE_AGE = 1209600  # 2 weeks
```

### Step 3: Test the Flow
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Add items to cart and proceed to checkout

3. Test both payment methods:
   - COD: Should go to review screen
   - UPI: Should show QR code screen

4. Complete checkout and verify order in admin panel

## üé® Customization Options

### Change QR Code Image Path
If you want to use a different filename:

In `checkout_premium.html`, line ~705:
```html
<img src="{% static 'store/images/YOUR-QR-CODE-NAME.png' %}" alt="UPI Payment QR Code">
```

### Add Additional Payment Methods
In `store/views.py`, add to the payment method handler:
```python
elif request.method == 'POST' and 'payment_method' in request.POST:
    payment_method = request.POST.get('payment_method', 'cod')
    
    if payment_method == 'upi':
        return redirect(f'/checkout/?session_id={session_id}&step=payment-qr')
    elif payment_method == 'card':  # NEW
        return redirect(f'/checkout/?session_id={session_id}&step=card-payment')
    else:
        return redirect(f'/checkout/?session_id={session_id}&step=review')
```

### Modify QR Code Display
Edit `checkout_premium.html` around line ~695 to customize:
- QR code size
- Background colors
- Instructions text
- Button styling

## üìä Admin Panel Features

View orders with payment information:
1. Go to: http://localhost:8000/admin/
2. Navigate to: Store ‚Üí Orders
3. You'll see columns for:
   - Order Number
   - Customer Name
   - Total Amount
   - **Payment Method** (COD/UPI)
   - **Payment Status** (Paid/Unpaid)
   - Order Status

Filter orders by:
- Payment method
- Payment status
- Date range

## üß™ Testing Checklist

## üöÄ Going Live Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. **Security:**
   - [ ] Enable HTTPS for secure payment
   - [ ] Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True` in production
   - [ ] Set `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True`

2. **Payment Verification:**
   - [ ] Set up webhook/API to verify UPI payments automatically
   - [ ] Consider adding manual payment verification in admin panel
   - [ ] Add email notification for new paid orders

3. **User Experience:**
   - [ ] Test on multiple devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - [ ] Ensure QR code is scannable from different screens
   - [ ] Add payment confirmation SMS/email
   - [ ] Add order tracking functionality

4. **Database:**
   - [ ] Backup database before going live
   - [ ] Set up regular database backups
   - [ ] Monitor order creation logs

## üìù Important Notes

### Payment Verification
‚ö†Ô∏è **Current implementation trusts user confirmation**

The current setup marks order as "paid" when user clicks "I Have Paid". For production:

1. **Option 1 - Manual Verification:**
   - Customer pays and confirms
   - You verify payment in your UPI app
   - Manually mark order as paid in admin panel

2. **Option 2 - Auto Verification (Recommended):**
   - Integrate with payment gateway API (Razorpay, PayU, etc.)
   - Automatic payment verification
   - Requires payment gateway account

3. **Option 3 - Hybrid:**
   - Accept payments via QR code
   - Customer uploads screenshot
   - Auto-match with UPI transaction ID

### Next Steps for Production

Consider implementing:
- Razorpay/PayU integration for automatic payment verification
- Payment screenshot upload feature
- UPI transaction ID entry field
- Admin panel payment verification workflow
- Automated payment confirmation emails
- Order status SMS notifications

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### QR Code Not Showing
- Check file exists: `store/static/store/images/payment-qr.png`
- Run: `python manage.py collectstatic`
- Clear browser cache

### Session Data Lost
- Check SESSION_ENGINE in settings.py
- Verify django_session table in database
- Check browser allows cookies

### Payment Method Not Saving
- Check view code saves to session
- Add debug prints to verify session data
- Check session_modified = True is set

### Order Not Created
- Check terminal for error messages
- Verify all required Order model fields
- Check checkout_data in session

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the terminal console for error messages
2. Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
3. Verify all session data is being saved correctly
4. Test in incognito mode to rule out cache issues
